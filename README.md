# Hand-Digit-Recognition-Using-ML-Techniques
##Objective
Recognition and recording of visual numbers can be a tedious process. Computer vision and accurate algorithmic recognition of numberscan incredibly improve the efficiency of these processes and be both faster and more accurate than a human recording of these numbers.While numbers are theoretically universal, how we represent them in writing, in font, and in any visual medium can vary. Supervisedmachine learning techniques such as KNN, SVMs, and neural networks are powerful methods that can find hidden general patterns to helpclassify digit numbers.We will be getting our data from an MNIST source which contains images of digits for model building. There are 70k observations total thatwe can split into for training and testing. With 784 pixel columns (features) and a single label column (response) for each observation, weshould have enough data for a robust model.
